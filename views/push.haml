  If your wallet is lost in the network, you can push
  it there once again, provided you remember the
  = succeed '.' do
    %a{href: 'https://blog.zold.io/2018/07/18/keygap.html'} keygap
  It's a harmless operation, you can do it as often as you like.

%p
  The wallet
  %code= user.item.id
  - if user.wallet_exists?
    is here.
  - else
    is absent.
