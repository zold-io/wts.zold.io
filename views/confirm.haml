  Confirm the Keygap

%p
  We just created a new Zold wallet
  %code= user.item.id
  for you. Each Zold wallet is a simple plain text file,
  which includes a public RSA key inside. The private RSA key
  is something you should keep secret, in order to send
  payments from your wallet. We created that private RSA key for you
  too and stored in our database. We extracted a small part of it
  and giving it to you now. You should keep it secret, you will
  need it later, in order to send payments.
  This is your
  = succeed ':' do
    %a{href: 'https://blog.zold.io/2018/07/18/keygap.html', title: 'Read more about Keygap'} keygap

%p
  %span.firebrick.monospace{style: 'font-size:4em;line-height:1em;'}
    = largetext(user.keygap)

%p
  You have to save it right now, together with your wallet ID
  = succeed '.' do
    %code= user.item.id
  Once you confirm that you saved it, we will destroy it from our database
  and will not be able to restore access to your wallet without this code.

%p
  Click,
  %a{href: iri.cut('/do-confirm').add(keygap: user.keygap), title: 'Click here when you are ready', onclick: "return confirm('Are you sure? Did you save the keygap and your wallet ID?')"} confirm
  when you are ready.
