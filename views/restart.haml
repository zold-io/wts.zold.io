  Restart

%p
  "Restart" means that a new
  %strong empty
  Zold wallet will be created for you.
  The existing wallet
  %code= confirmed_user.item.id
  - if confirmed_user.wallet_exists?
    with the balance of
    %code= confirmed_user.wallet(&:balance)
  will
  %strong.firebrick disappear
  from the system.
  It will still exist in Zold network, but you won't see it here anymore.
  The private RSA key will also be regenerated.

%p
  Before you do that we
  %strong strongly
  recommend you to download your
  %a{href: iri.cut('/key')} private RSA key
  and record the ID of your wallet,
  just in case you change you mind in the future.

%p
  If you understand what you are doing, click
  %a{href: iri.cut('/create'), onclick: "return confirm('The wallet will be re-created, the existing RSA private key will be deleted from our database, are you sure?')"} here
  (think twice).
